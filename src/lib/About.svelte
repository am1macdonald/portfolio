		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>
                        I'm Adam MacDonald, a Senior Full-Stack Developer with 2+ years of professional experience
			who has found my true calling in back-end and infrastructure engineering. With expertise in JavaScript,
			Scala, and Go, I specialize in building scalable server-side systems, optimizing database architectures, 
			and implementing DevOps solutions including Docker containerization and CI/CD pipelines.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			At Urbint (formerly ComPeters Inc.), I've enhanced GeoServer configurations, optimized PostGIS database schemas,
			and developed efficient Node.js server routesâ€”reducing map loading times from 90 seconds to under 10 and designing 
			flexible search systems that support ~50 customizable parameters. I'm now seeking opportunities to leverage my
			technical expertise in back-end engineering and infrastructure management roles where I can continue building reliable,
			scalable systems.
