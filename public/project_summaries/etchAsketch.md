When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? We have a saboteur aboard. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Sorry, Data. Well, that's certainly good to know.
