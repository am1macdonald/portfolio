"Sunny Days" gives users a simple interface to search for and find weather forecasts. The browser Geolocation API or a built-in search function can be used by users to find local weather data. The application fetches weather data from [OpenWeather's](https://openweathermap.org/) API. The app can display weather using either imperial or metric units, which are user selectable.

The app calls Geolocation services from OpenWeather to retrieve city data to get a usable location from the browser's Geolocation API.
