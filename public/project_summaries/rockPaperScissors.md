About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would _never_ do that to you. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Your head is not an artifact! Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Ensign Babyface! Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.
