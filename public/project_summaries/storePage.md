"Mega-lo-Mart" is a mock e-commerce page that uses React Router to deliver a multi-page shopping experience in a single-page application.

I built this project to showcase my knowledge of React hooks and Test Driven Development. This store page is a tribute to my favourite animation of all time, 'King of the Hill.'

The store uses SASS and CSS modules for full responsiveness.

Technologies & tools: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, React, react hooks, SCSS preprocessing, Node Package Manager, REST APIs & ES6 modules.
