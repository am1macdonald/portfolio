Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Sorry, Data. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. You enjoyed that. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? and attack the Romulans. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. I'll be sure to note that in my log. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Computer, belay that order. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them.
