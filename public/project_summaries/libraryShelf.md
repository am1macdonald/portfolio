"The Stacks" is an application for users to track their reading lists. It is fully responsive for usability across all manner of devices.

The app allows users to add books they have read or books on their 'to read' list.

"The Stacks" will soon be integrated with the Firebase backend to allow users to access their data across multiple devices. Also, it will use the GoodReads API to provide the user with rating data for books they wish to read before they provide their rating.

Technologies & tools: JavaScript, HTML, CSS & Sass
