I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Computer, belay that order. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Ensign Babyface! I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. The unexpected is our normal routine. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Wouldn't that bring about chaos? A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would _never_ do that to you. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir.
